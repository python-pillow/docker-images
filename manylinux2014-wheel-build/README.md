# Wheel Builder image

This image is a little different than the other images in this repo --
it's intended to be a quick way to build manylinux wheels with the
production version of the libraries for debugging and testing
purposes. This is designed to work as a single Docker image that
doesn't require privilege or multiple images to run.

Like the other images in this repo, it expects that there is a Pillow
source directory mounted at /Pillow. Unlike the others, it puts the
output files in /output. This should be mounted as a volume to the host
to retrieve the finished wheel.

Setting the environment variable `DEBUG=1` will create a build with
symbols for debugging with Valgrind/GDB.

The Makefile has several new commands:

* make wheel: Makes a Python 3.8 manylinux2014 wheel, and puts it in the
./out directory.
* make 37|38|39|310|311: These are specific commands to make
the corresponding 3.x version in the ./out directory.

The test target here is mainly to validate the image build, it is
assumed that the builds will be used for other purposes or tested in
other images.


# Sources

* build_depends is from our integration with OSS-Fuzz
* yum_install is syntactic sugar to make the multibuild repo work with
  the base manylinux wheel image, rather than with its custom set of
  images
